# GodotTileReflection
A godot tool for smartly painting tiles based on simplified inputs

A system that let you define entierly custom and flexible rules for tiles to be set

that then piece together tilemaps based on geometry. Its designed to be mostly visual and very simple to use, its far more consistent then the build in tiles, but can be a little bit more complex to get into.
